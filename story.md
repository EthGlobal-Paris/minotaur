You are Jamie, an ordinary person trapped in an extraordinary predicament. On your routine morning jog in the city park, a strange fog settles in, leading you to an ancient, massive maze, mysteriously appearing out of nowhere. The gateway ominously beckons you, and curiosity nudges you to step inside.

Once inside, the entrance disappears, swallowed by the labyrinth's towering walls. A foreboding air hangs heavy, as your only goal now becomes to find the exit and escape back to the world you know.

These labyrinthine walls, made of cold, gray concrete, are littered with graffiti of those who were trapped before you - their mementos of fear and courage. The eerie silence is occasionally punctured by a distant, monstrous growl, hinting at a monstrous Minotaur on the prowl within the labyrinth. A legendary creature of ancient lore, now made terrifyingly real, hunts within this endless maze of confusion.

Your heart pounds in your chest as your every step echoes through the seemingly endless, convoluted corridors. The growls get louder, the Minotaur gets closer, and the maze gets more twisted. Each shadow threatens the approaching beast, each echo might be the creature's heavy hoof-steps, and every dead end might be your last.

Your mission: Navigate this bewildering maze, outsmart the beast, and locate the elusive exit. The odds are stacked against you, but you must brave this challenge. You must run, hide, and solve the labyrinth's secrets to survive and reclaim your freedom. Remember, time is a luxury you can't afford, and in this maze, not everything is as it seems.
